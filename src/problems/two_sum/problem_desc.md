===
## Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Problem Input(s):
- **int[] nums** - The input array of numbers
- **int target** - The number trying to be reached 

## Examples:

### Example 1:

```
Inputs: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1] because nums[0] + nums[1] = 9.
