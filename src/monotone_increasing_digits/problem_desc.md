Monotone Increasing Digits | Leetcode Problem #738
===
## Problem Statement:
An integer has monotone increasing digits if and only if each pair of adjacent digits, x and y, satisfy the property that x <= y. Given a non-negative integer N, find the largest number that is less than or equal to N with monotone increasing digits.
## Problem Input(s):
- **int N** - The upperbound for largest monotone number. N can be any integer within the range [0, 10^9].
## Examples:

### Example 1:
```
Input: N = 10
Output: 9
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: N = 1234
Output: 1234
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: N = 332
Output: 299
